# simple_digital_clock
This is a digital clock I have made using python and Tkinter(used to create loads of GUI (Graphic User Interface) applications).

REQUIREMENTS:
If you're on window OS you don't really need to install anything since our simple digital clock app will be using only built-in modules time and Tkinter.

But if you're running Linux OS most of the time pre installed python interpreter doesn't come with the Tkinter installed, therefore you might need to install it manually.
